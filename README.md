# NaviOverlay
ðŸŽµ Now Playing Overlay for [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/) music servers. It displays real-time playback info like track title, artist, and album art in a stream-friendly overlay you can use on OBS, Twitch, or any custom frontend or videos.
It's a simple tool for those who want a private way to display what they're listening to, fully privately.

Note: I'm still a beginner and this is my first open source project feel free to criticize and contribute to the project as much as you want, hope you like it :)
